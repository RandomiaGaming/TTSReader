exists that prohibits or restricts in any manner, your ability to perform work for Kohl's, you must provide a written verification that is
satisfactory to Kohl’s that releases you from any such obligation. Kohl's will acknowledge receipt of the satisfactory document in
writing. Until Kohl's notifies you in writing of the receipt of a satisfactory releasing document, you shall have no employment rights
hereunder. It should also be understood by you that Kohl's has no interest in obtaining any proprietary or confidential information
from your former employer. You should not bring any such information (in written or electronic form) to Kohl's and Kohl's will not
